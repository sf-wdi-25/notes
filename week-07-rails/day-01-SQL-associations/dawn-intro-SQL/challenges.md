#Challenges

1. Use SQL aggregators to get the total value of the inventory, calculated as the sum of the price*quantity for each item.

2. Create a books table based on the printed table above. It should have attributes for `id`, `title`, `pub_year`, `isbn`, and `author_id`. For now, just make the `author_id` an INTEGER.

3. Add the classic children's books from earlier in this readme into your books table.

4. The library wants to start selling off old books. Add a `book_id` attribute to the products table so that the library can store books as inventory.

5. Insert the books from your books table into your products table. Make up a price and quantity for them.
