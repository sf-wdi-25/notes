**Your project will be evaluated based on the following criteria:**

* **Technical Requirements**: Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements?

* **Creativity**: Did you add a personal spin or creative element to your project? Did you deliver something of value to the end user?

* **Code Quality**: Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, modularity, and semantic naming? Did you comment your code?

* **Problem Solving**: Are you able to defend why you implemented your solution in a certain way? Can you demonstrate that you thought through alternative implementations? 

You'll be receiving written feedback from your instructors.  The criteria above will be evaluated as either **does not meet expectations**, **meets expectations**, or **exceeds expectations**.
